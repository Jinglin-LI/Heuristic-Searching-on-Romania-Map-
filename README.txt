Implement heuristic searching on the Romania Map by three different heuristic function:

 * 1) straight distance
 * 2) f = (1 - w)g + wh, where w = 0.25
 * 3) f = (1 - w)g + wh, where w = 0.75

 * Where g() function is the path length from the source, h() function is the direct distance to the destination.
